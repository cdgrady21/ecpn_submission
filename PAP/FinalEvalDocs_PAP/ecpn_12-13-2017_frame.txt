Public Goods Game Frame
	- No longer a reward/thank you.
	- As Danjuma said, maybe doesn't make sense to frame as "don't have time" since we will still be active in these communities.
	- Frame as: we have money not for a project, but to be given directly to community members, for you to do with as you please.  Your community and the joint farmer/pastoralist community set up a community fund to be managed by a Project Committee with both farmers and pastoralists.  You may donate to that project committee or you can keep the money.  We have another donor who will match any contribution you make to the Project Committee.

Public Goods Project Committees
	- This can be standard between all communities, both treatment and control.
	- Following Fearon et al. (2009), we should tell the communities that receipt of funds depends on completed a form that tells us: (1) the community members who will form a committee to manage the money, and (2) plans for how the funds will be spent.
	- Another aspect of the amount donated is trust in the people on this committee.  More trust in these people --> more contributions.

Control communities
	- Will we be able to get consent to survey and conduct this public goods "game"?
	- Could knowledge that we are coming to bring "funds for development" affect survey responses about farmers/pastoralists?
	- Will they be able to form a project committee to manage these funds?

Giving the money and soliciting contributions
	- Do this in one private place as a group?  Farmers and pastoralists separately, or get all 100 people in a site together?
		- Currently separate.  My thought was that separate will be logistically much easier.
	- Give them envelops and have a donation box?
	- Give everyone four 500 Naira notes?  Could also do a 1,000 note, a 500 note, and five 100 notes.

	- not wanting to give out money: maybe materials?
	- do no harm: give more than if people give max so every COMMUNITY gets the $500.
	- public goods game: experience with intergroup decision-making, or intergroup trust?
		- benefits PG: what these communities tend to do to solve problems
		- benefits DG: no chance for 
	- people will talk about what they did: harm safety?
		- make people know it is totally okay to keep the money
	- other cooperative behaviors to measure
	- SIMPLIFY SIMPLIFY SIMPLIFY the game

# Money
	- waiving ICR for this money, or a lower rate: allow subaward
