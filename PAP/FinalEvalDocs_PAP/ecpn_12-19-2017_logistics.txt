SURVEY
Looking at baseline now
	- what to cut?
		- chris to look at some things that we didn't use
	- what to add?
		- add some questions for baseline of cost extension
		- subtle changes asked for with USAID new indicators...but we should not change question wording.
	- additional sites are control sites

PAP
	- add the community level analysis to the PAP

PUBLIC GOODS GAME
	- one off game
	- concern with punishment (people do it when allowed, shows some anger)
	- MULTIPLIER: instead of $5/$5, maybe $2/8.

	- Fearon et al. (2014) - communities did not know this was tied to the NGO project.
		- and game was played before survey

ECPN MONEY
	- subaward is now a no-go
	- western union transfer: send money in my name for a fee.  go to any western union agent with my name.
		- fee is flat + %.
		- could also use MoneyGram 
	- carry $9,900 and transfer the rest?
