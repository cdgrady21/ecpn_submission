Will eventually move this stuff to github repo

1.) Outcomes
- Re-specify indices to be in line with rationalist/trust story.  e_makeIndices
- check results of new indices/outcomes.  create new g_analysis file.

2.) Subgroups
- Farmers vs Pastoralists

3.) Combining Outcomes/Correcting Multiple Tests
- Which outcomes would be combined?  Which hypotheses would need to be tested together and so corrected?  These are probably same answer.
- Which outcomes are different in this "theory of change"
	- intervention -> trust -> bargaining -> less conflict.



MINOR
- range rescale or standard deviation rescale? (e_makeIndices).


RANDOM
- trust and sharing resources relationship?
