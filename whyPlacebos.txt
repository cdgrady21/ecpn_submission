I shortened it. But here is the text if you disagree: but address ways that our results could be spurious. Attitudes about violence tells us about social desirability bias because respondents may feel social pressure to answer violence questions in a desirable way. Trust towards religious outgroups tell us if general tolerance was increasing more in treatment communities than control communities; it could also be affected by social desirability bias. And radio listening could correlate with things that affect outgroup tolerance (e.g. access to information). If the intervention affects these placebo outcomes, then we worry that other self-reports in treatment communities were affected by social desirability bias, general increases in tolerance unrelated to the intervention, or other factors unrelated to the intervention
