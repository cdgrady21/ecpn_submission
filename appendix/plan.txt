put appendices here.

Desired appendices
- Explaining randomization inference and bootstrapping
- Additive indices instead of ICW indices
- Placebo analysis + components of placebo
- Possible mechanisms?
- Survey questions
- Results with differencing method vs results with controlling-for method
- Balance: TR vs CO for all baseline outcomes (Separate for svy and obs)
- raw vs ranked variables to create the index



Question:
Should Rfile from "data_code" folder create files here?
OR
Should Rfiles here grab data from the "data_code" folder?


Lots of files are in data_and_code/survey_dat/d_analysis
