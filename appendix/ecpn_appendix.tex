\subsection{Appendix A: Randomization Inference and
Bootstrapping}\label{appendix-a-randomization-inference-and-bootstrapping}}

Randomization inference and bootstrapping are nonparametric methods to
generate \(p\)-values (randomization inference) and confidence intervals
(bootstrapping). With \emph{randomization inference}, we first shuffle
the treatment variable to break the relationship between treatment and
outcomes. Next we regress outcomes on treatment using our regression
equation and store the resulting coefficient. Lastly, we repeat that
process 10,000 times to create the distribution of coefficients we would
observe if treatment had no effect on outcomes -- the null hypothesis.
Our \(p\)-value is the proportion of the null distribution that is
greater than or equal to our observed coefficient.

\emph{Bootstrapping} for standard errors is similar, but instead of
shuffling the treatment indicator we resample units with replacement. By
resampling with replacement, we create the empirical distribution of our
data and the range of possible treatment effects we might observe if we
repeated the experiment 10,000 times. The treatment effect at the 2.5th
percentile and at the 97.5th percentile are equivalent to a 95\%
confidence interval {[}@efron1994introduction{]}.

In each of these procedures, we mimic our randomization process by
randomizing/resampling the intervention to communities in site-level
clusters and within state blocks. This means that both communities in an
implementation site (farmers and pastoralists) will always be
treated/sampled together and that assignment to the intervention and
resampling are conducted separately in Nassarawa and Benue, just as the
intervention was assigned in this study. This procedure ensures that our
null distribution (for \(p\)-values) is created by randomizing the
intervention between exchangeable units and that our empirical
distribution (for confidence intervals) is created by resampling units
as they were sampled.

\subsection{Appendix B: Robustness checks for
analysis}\label{appendix-b-robustness-checks-for-analysis}}

These tables shows results with different ways of making indices
(additive vs inverse-covariance weighted), different models for
estimating effects (differencing vs controlling-for), and different ways
of coding count variables (raw vs ranked). Each table is an outcome.
Rows are results for different ways of creating the outcomes. Columns
show the coefficient from OLS regression, true p-value from
randomization inference, and a binary ``base'' indicator showing which
method was used in the paper.

index: inverse-covariance weights (``cw'') or additive (``ind''). model:
controlling-for (``cont'') or differencing (``diff''). Note that not not
all outcomes are indices, some outcomes are endline only, and only
contact outcomes use count variables.

\textbf{Public Goods Game}

``Thank you very much for participating in our survey. Before I go,
there is one last thing. As you may have heard, we have development
funds to use in this community. We have randomly selected you as one of
the 50 people to receive these funds. These funds are not for a Mercy
Corps project, but rather for you to keep personally or to donate to a
community fund.

We have 1,000 Naira to give to you. It is yours, and you can use it
either way--for yourself or for a community good.

Your community and {[}joint farmer/pastoralist community{]} have created
a project committee to whom you can donate this money so that it may be
used to help both communities. The project committee has 4 people from
each community. We have found a donor that will match the funds that you
all contribute to the project committee, so that if you donate 100 Naira
the project committee receives 300 Naira, and if you donate all 1,000
Naira the project committee receives 3,000 Naira. You are welcome to
donate none, some, or all of the money to the project committee.

These are your individual donation envelopes. All the donations will be
private -- only you will know how much money you donated. It essential
that you keep how much you give private -- please do not tell anyone. I
have with me a donation envelope to collect donations. Please go into
your home, put however much of the 1,000 Naira you wish to donate to the
project committee in the envelope, take whatever amount you want to keep
for yourself, and come back to place your envelope in the donation
envelope. Remember, you are welcome to donate none, some, or all of the
money to the project committee. After that we are finished and you may
continue your day. We will come back and publicly announce how much
money your community's project committee will receive.''
